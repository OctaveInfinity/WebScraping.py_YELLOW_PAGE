# WebScraping.py_YELLOW_PAGES

This is a simple Web-Scraping for YellowPages website https://www.yellowpages.com/austin-tx/plumbers. 

It was written by me from scratch in Python language with Requests_HTML library (module). 

I spent about 12 man-hours in the free time from my main work to implement this test assignment (analysis, prototyping, coding, testing, refactoring, etc …).
